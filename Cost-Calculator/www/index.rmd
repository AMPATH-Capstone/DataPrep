<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This application was developed by graduate students at the Paul H. O'Neill School of Public and Environmental Affairs at Indiana University - Bloomington for the Academic Model Providing Access to Healthcare (AMPATH) partnership. The intended purpose of this application is to provide AMPATH with a way to visually compare the direct and opportunity costs of clinical and cooperative care models. This calculator was produced as part of a graduate capstone course in the fall semester of 2020. The data and calculations used to present these figures are sourced from a study overseen by Dr. Suzanne Goodrich and through capstone research.</p>
